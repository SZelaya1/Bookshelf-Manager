## ðŸ§  OOP Concepts Used

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Abstract Class** | `Book` is an abstract base class for all book types |
| **Inheritance** | `FictionBook`, `NonFictionBook`, `Textbook` inherit from `Book` |
| **Method Overloading** | Multiple versions of `addBook()` and `search()` methods |
| **Method Overriding** | Subclasses override methods like `getSummary()` |
| **Polymorphism** | `List<Book>` holds various book types |
| **Further Inheritance** | e.g. `Textbook` extends `NonFictionBook` |
| **for-each Loops** | Used to iterate and display book lists |
| **Multiple Lists** | Separate lists may store all books, search results, etc. |
